What I am most *passionate* about is 
[Artificial General Intelligence](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/skynet.png)(AGI); 
the pursuit of trying to replicate human-like behavior in computers. 
This is my lifelong goal. 
As of late (August 2nd, 2020), I  haven't been as productive as 
I'd like to be in this regard. 
Motivation has been severely lacking, due in part to just 
finishing University where they had a ridiculously strong 
emphasis on modern 
<strike>[object-oriented programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM&feature=emb_title)</strike>,
of which I was not a fan. 

## Currently learning

* [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) to start learning functional languages before starting [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

## Currently working on

* A simple [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to have a domain to learn Natural Language Processing (NLP).
